We've tried several different implementations. At first, we tried to solve 10 puzzles at the beginning, make several minibots and build a silo. We then find out that this implementation costs too many cycles on solving puzzles so we had less time picking corn with our mainbot. We finally gave up on minibots, and came up with a solution of only creating minibots when our opponent builds a silo and destroying the silo.
